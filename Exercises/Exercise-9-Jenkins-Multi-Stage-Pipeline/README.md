# Exercise 9: Jenkins Multi-Stage Pipeline

## Objective
Create and execute a Jenkins Pipeline that performs multiple stages (Build, Test, Deploy) for a sample Python Flask application.

## Files Created
- `app.py`: Simple Python Flask application.
- `requirements.txt`: Defines the Python dependencies (`flask==2.1.2`).
- `test_app.py`: Unit tests using the `unittest` framework.
- `Jenkinsfile`: Defines the declarative Jenkins pipeline with stages: Build, Test, Deploy, Run Application, and Test Application.

## Jenkins Setup Details
To run the pipeline successfully, the Jenkins environment needs Python and Flask installed. This is achieved by running the following inside the Jenkins Docker container:
```bash
apt-get update
apt install python3 python3-pip python3.11-venv python3-flask -y
```
